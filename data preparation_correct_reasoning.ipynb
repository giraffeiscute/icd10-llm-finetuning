When she awoke at 1530 she found that her left\\nhand was numb and very weak. She has fluctuating left hand\\nweakness and clumsiness at baseline but this was weaker than\\nusual as she had trouble lifting it up from the bed. She went\\ndownstairs to tell her husband. There, her voice was dysarthric.\\nShe tried to eat something and noticed that the left side of her\\nface was numb. Her daughter told her she looked like she was\\ngoing to fall over. Because of these things, she presented to \\nthe\\nemergency department. There she was hypoglycemic to 55 per her\\nhusband\\'s report; she received a snack and IV dextrose and her\\nsugars improved.

Neither she nor\\nher husband are not able to describe a typical seizure to me. \\nPer\\nreview of the chart, she has fluctuating symptoms of left hand\\nnumbness, weakness, dysarthria and aphasia. EEG demonstrated\\ninterictal discharges and bursts of sharp slowing in the right\\ntemporal region. Overall, this was felt to be consistent with\\nfocal seizures originating in the right parietal lobe with \\nspread\\nto the right frontal lobe.
